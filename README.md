# testproject
This is a small workout recording app developed by Mubashar Ali. 
I am using MVVM architecture for this project. I used this because I am using provider state management in it and to make the code easy using provider this is the best architecture. 
I am using two packages:

1: provider
I am using it because it makes the code easy and very understandable. Like my logic are in different files, I can update data without using the setState() function, etc. This is good for developing large apps with complex code.

2: test
I am using this package to implement unit and widget test for my app according to reqquirnment.
